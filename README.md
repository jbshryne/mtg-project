# MTG CONCLAVE

## About The Project

My website will be called "MTG Conclave", utilizing the [Magic: the Gathering API](https://magicthegathering.io/) card database.  The main feature of my site will be a Card Search interface, similar to some other sites like [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/), but with a couple of distinct features:

### "Improved" Options for Sorting Search Results 

* Specifically, the ability to sort cards by Card Type / Subtype, which was a feature I loved from an old database site that got merged into Scryfall a few years back & that Scryfall has never chosen to implement.

### Ability to Specify "Random" Searches

* While Scryfall has a button to pull a totally random card from all of Magic, I'd like the ability to select random cards within certain parameters -- i.e., a random card from a specific set, or of a specific Creature type and rarity.

### Minigame(s)?

* This might be more of a stretch goal, but I'm thinking about a game or two that utilizie that "specified randomization" logic, like being given art from a random card from a specific set and guessing the name of the card.  (These games could have difficulty levels, as in Easy being multiple choice, and Advanced being you just type in your answer)
